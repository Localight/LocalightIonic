# LocalLight

This project is a local giftcard. Our objective is to make a community where you can electronically send giftcards to your friends, and use those giftcards at local shops.
This will encourage community, and help people become more involved in local shops.

## Installation

To install this project, you must have the following installed on your machine:  <br />
NodeJS - https://nodejs.org/  <br />
MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.org/

Clone the repository into your local computer. <br />
Open a terminal window and run "sudo mongod". This will start the mongodb server. Leave that window open. <br />
Open a second terminal window. This will be your development window. <br />
Run "npm install" and "bower install". This will install all of the dependencies of the project onto your computer. <br />
You can then use "grunt serve" to host a local web server of the live project directory. You will then be able to view the site at 0.0.0.0:9000. <br />
In addition, you will probably want to be running the backend in conjunction. You can clone that repository and follow the instructions to make both work in tandem. http://github.com/localism/localightbackend
Any changes you make to project files will be auto-reloaded in the browser.

## History

This project was originally created in MeanJS, however has now been switched to plain components of the MEAN stack. This was due to bad implementation and coding on the old project. We have now started fresh, and are using MEAN to accomplish the project goals. To assemble mean, we have compiled plain MongoDB, Express and Angular through independant sources.
